# Box from Lab'Cesi

## Introduction

At the engineer school, sometimes we must bring components from one place to another. Right now our laboratory designed a box which could keep small components in case of loss and make them ealiser to carry. In oder to organize clearer, these boxes are enable to overlap together.

## First designed box
The box called"boite-labcesi" whose size is"90mmX100mmX50mm". Our box has 5 surfaces, otherwise there is a bevel in front of the box which makes people find components more convenient. We designed eight holes on the top and eight sppourts on the bottom to overlap two boxes.
## Improvement

Although we achieved overlapping in first design, those eight supports on the bottom were very figile. According to our previous experience, we reduced eight holes to four but created them bigger.
